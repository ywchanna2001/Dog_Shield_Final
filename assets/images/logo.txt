// This is a placeholder for the app logo image
// In a real application, you would replace this with actual image files such as:
// logo.png, logo@2x.png, logo@3x.png
//
// To use SVG, place a logo.svg file in this directory
// Make sure to use the appropriate Flutter library to load the image type you choose
