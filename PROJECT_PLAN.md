# DogShield AI - Project Plan

## Project Overview
DogShield AI is an innovative mobile application leveraging AI technology for pet health management and early rabies detection in dogs. The app provides smart reminders for pet care routines and uses image/video analysis to detect potential rabies symptoms.

## Project Timeline
The project will be divided into the following phases:

### Phase 1: Research and Planning (2 weeks)
- Research user experience for pet health applications
- Market analysis of existing pet care applications
- Define user personas and user journeys
- Create detailed wireframes and UI/UX designs
- Finalize technology stack and architecture

### Phase 2: Core Development (4 weeks)
- Set up project structure and architecture
- Implement authentication system (Login/Register)
- Develop main dashboard and navigation
- Create pet registration and profile management
- Design and implement database structure

### Phase 3: AI Integration (6 weeks)
- Develop image/video upload functionality
- Research and train ML models for rabies detection
- Implement AI-based analysis for uploaded content
- Integration with TensorFlow Lite or other mobile ML frameworks
- Testing and validation of AI predictions

### Phase 4: Reminder System (3 weeks)
- Design and implement vaccination tracking
- Develop medication reminder system
- Create feeding schedule management
- Implement notification system
- Design and develop deworming tracking

### Phase 5: Testing and Optimization (3 weeks)
- User interface testing
- Performance optimization
- Security testing
- User acceptance testing
- Bug fixes and improvements

### Phase 6: Deployment and Launch (2 weeks)
- Final quality assurance
- App store submission
- Monitoring and maintenance setup
- Marketing and launch preparations

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Flutter for cross-platform mobile development
- **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage)
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow Lite, Firebase ML Kit
- **Analytics**: Firebase Analytics
- **Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging
